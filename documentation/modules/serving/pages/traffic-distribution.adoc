At the end of this chapter you will be able to :

* Providing custom name to deployment
* Understanding advanced deployment techniques 
* Apply blue-green deployment pattern
* Apply Canary Release Deployment pattern
* Reduce the service visibility


As you learnt from previous chapter, Knative always routes traffic to the **latest** revision of the service. It is possible to split the traffic amongst the available revisions.

// [[deploying-revisions]]
// == Arbitrary Revision Names

// By default Knative generates a random revision names for the service based with Knative service's `metadata.name` as prefix. 

// The following service deployments will show how to use an arbitrary revision names for the services. The service are exactly same `greeter` service except that their Revision name is specified using the service revision template spec.

== Deploy colors service

To explore the goals of this chapter, we will be using a colors service called *blue-green-canary*.

== Deploy a New Revision of a Service

.Twelve-factor app
****
https://12factor.net/[12factor.net] defines the twelve-factor app as a methodology for building software-as-a-service apps that:

- Use declarative formats for setup automation, to minimize time and cost for new developers joining the project;
- Have a clean contract with the underlying operating system, offering maximum portability between execution environments;
- Are suitable for deployment on modern cloud platforms, obviating the need for servers and systems administration;
- Minimize divergence between development and production, enabling continuous deployment for maximum agility;
- And can scale up without significant changes to tooling, architecture, or development practices.
- The twelve-factor methodology can be applied to apps written in any programming language, and which use any combination of backing services (database, queue, memory cache, etc).
****

In line with *12-Factor* principle, Knative rolls out new deployment whenever the Service *Configuration* changes, and creates immutable version of code and configuration called *revision*. An example of configuration change could for e.g. an update of Service image, a change to environment variables or add liveness/readiness probes.

Let us now change the configuration of the service by updating the service environment variable *BLUE_GREEN_CANARY_COLOR* to make the browser display *green* color with greeting text as *Namaste*.

[#tag-service-revisions]
== Tag Revisions

As you had observed that the Knative service `blue-green-canary` now has two revisions namely *blue-green-canary-xjygh-1* and *blue-green-canary-yzrwq-2*. As the Revision names are autogenerated it is hard to comprehend to which code/configuration set it corresponds to. To overcome this problem Knative provides *tagging* of revision names that allows one to tag a revision name to a logical human understanable names called *tags*.

As our colors service shows different colors on the browser let us tag the revisions with color,

List the existing revisions,

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
kn revision list -s blue-green-canary
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
NAME                        SERVICE             TRAFFIC   TAGS   GENERATION   AGE   CONDITIONS   READY   REASON
blue-green-canary-yzrwq-2   blue-green-canary   100%             2            23m   3 OK / 4     True
blue-green-canary-xjygh-1   blue-green-canary                    1            51m   3 OK / 4     True
----

When Knative rolls out a new revision, it increments the `GENERATION` by *1* and then routes *100%* of the `TRAFFIC` to it, hence we can use the `GENERATION` or `TRAFFIC` to identify the latest reivsion. 

=== Tag Blue

----

As *green* happend to be latest revision it has been tagged with name `lastest` in addition to `green`.

Let us use the tag names for easier identification of the revision and perform traffic distribution amongst them.

[[blue-green]]
== Applying Blue-Green Deployment Pattern

Knative offers a simple way of switching 100% of the traffic from one Knative service revision (blue) to another newly rolled out revision (green). If the new revision (e.g. green) has erroneous behavior then it is easy to rollback the change.

In this exercise you will applying the Blue/Green deployment pattern with the Knative Service called greeter. You have already deployed two <<deploying-revisions,revisions>> of blue-green-canary identified using the tags  `blue` and `green`.

With the deployment of *green* revison you noticed that Knative automatically started to routing 100% of the traffic to `blue-green-canary-yzrwq-2`. 

Now let us assume, due to a critical bug  we need to roll back `green` to `blue`.

The following Knative Service YAML is identical to the previously deployed `green` except that we have added the _traffic_ section to indicate that 100% of the traffic should be routed to `blue`.

Before you rollback the revision, refresh the browser window where you have opened the blue-green-canary service, to make sure it is still showing *green* browser page with greeting *Namaste*.

Now apply the update Knative service configuration using the command as shown in following listing:

=== Rollback to blue

Route all the traffic of service `blue-green-canary` to blue revision of the service:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kn service update blue-green-canary --traffic blue=100,green=0,latest=0
----

NOTE: We use the tag names to identify the revisions

Let us list all revisions with tags:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kn revision list --namespace {tutorial-namespace}
----

Based on the revision tags that we created earlier, the output should be like:

[.console-output]
[source,text,subs="quotes"]
----
NAME                        SERVICE             TRAFFIC   TAGS           GENERATION   AGE   CONDITIONS   READY   REASON
blue-green-canary-yzrwq-2   blue-green-canary             latest,green   2            56m   4 OK / 4     True
blue-green-canary-xjygh-1   blue-green-canary   #100%#      #blue#           1            83m   4 OK / 4     True
----

Let us list the available sub-routes:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
{kubernetes-cli} -n {tutorial-namespace} get ksvc greeter -oyaml \
 | yq r - 'status.traffic[*].url'
----

The above command should return you three sub-routes for the main `greeter` route:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,attributes"]
----
http://latest-blue-green-canary.knativetutorial.192.168.64.13.nip.io #<.>
http://blue-blue-green-canary.knativetutorial.192.168.64.13.nip.io #<.>
http://green-blue-green-canary.knativetutorial.192.168.64.13.nip.io  #<.>
----

<1> the sub route for the traffic tag `latest`
<2> the sub route for the traffic tag `blue`
<3> the sub route for the traffic tag `green`

You will notice that the command does not create any new configuration/revision/deployment as there was no application update (e.g. image tag, env var, etc), but when you call the service, Knative scales up the `blue` that shows *blue* browser page with greeting *Hello*.

blue-green-canary-yzrwq-2-deployment-6cb545df65-ktqc2   0/2     Terminating   0          2m
----

Since `blue` is the active revision now, the existing `green` pod is getting terminated as no future requests will be served by it.

[TIP]
====
As an exercise, flip all the traffic back to `green` using `kn` command.

[[canary-release]]
== Applying Canary Release Pattern

A Canary release is more effective when you want to reduce the risk of introducing new feature. It allows you a more effective feature-feedback loop before rolling out the change to your entire user base.

Knative allows you to split the traffic between revisions in increments as small as 1%.

To see this in action, apply the following Knative service definition that will split the traffic 80% to 20% between `blue` and `green`.

To roll out the greeter canary deployment use the following command:

.Create greeter canary Deployment

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kn service update blue-green-canary -n {tutorial-namespace} \
  --traffic="blue=80" \
  --traffic="green=20" 
----

As in the previous section on <<blue-green>> deployments, the command will not create any new configuration/revision/deployment. To observe the traffic distribution, open the Service Route URL in your browser window. 

You will notice the browser alternating betwee green and blue color, with majority of the time staying with blue.

image::blue-green-canary.gif[]

You should also notice that two pods are running representing both `blue` and `green`:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+quotes,+attributes,+macros"]
----
watch "{kubernetes-cli} get pods -n {tutorial-namespace}"
----

blue-green-canary-yzrwq-2-deployment-8564bf5b5b-gtvh4   2/2     Running   0          14s
----

[NOTE,caption=Challenge]
====
As a challenge:

- Deploy a new revision called "yellow" which will show Yellow Color browser page (Hex for yellow is `#f2f25e`) and a greeting text `Bonjour`.

- Create the tag called yellow, mapping to yellow revision of the service.

- Update the traffic distribution to be 70% to blue, 20% to green and 10% to yellow.
