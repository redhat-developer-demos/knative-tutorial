== Events, Triggers and Brokers

With Knative 0.5.0, Broker and Trigger objects are introduced to make event filtering easier.

Brokers provide selection of events by attributes. They receive events and forwards them to subscribers defined by matching Triggers.

Triggers provide a way of filtering of events by attributes. They are attached to subscribers and make the subscribers receive the events only they are interested in.

[#broker]
== Broker

First of all, we need to create a Broker. Knative eventing provides a Broker named `default` when a special label is added to a namespace.

[tabs]
====
kubectl::
+
--
[#eventing-trigger-broker-label-namespace]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",linenums]
----
kubectl label namespace {tutorial-namespace} knative-eventing-injection=enabled
----
copyToClipboard::eventing-trigger-broker-label-namespace[]

--
oc::
+
--
[#eventing-trigger-broker-oc-label-namespace]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",linenums]
----
oc label namespace {tutorial-namespace} knative-eventing-injection=enabled
----
copyToClipboard::eventing-trigger-broker-oc-label-namespace[]
--
====

This will create the `default` broker. Execute the following command to see it:

[tabs]
====
kubectl::
+
--
[#eventing-trigger-broker-see-broker]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",linenums]
----
kubectl -n {tutorial-namespace} get brokers.eventing.knative.dev
----
copyToClipboard::eventing-trigger-broker-see-broker[]

--
oc::
+
--
[#eventing-trigger-broker-oc-see-broker]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",linenums]
----
oc label namespace {tutorial-namespace} get brokers.eventing.knative.dev
----
copyToClipboard::eventing-trigger-broker-oc-see-broker[]
--
====

Output should be similar to below:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
NAME      READY     REASON    HOSTNAME                                           AGE
default   True                default-broker.knativetutorial.svc.cluster.local   2m
----

Labeling the namespace will also create some pods that are related to the `default` broker.

[tabs]
====
kubectl::
+
--
[#eventing-trigger-broker-see-broker-pods]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",linenums]
----
kubectl -n {tutorial-namespace} get pods
----
copyToClipboard::eventing-trigger-broker-see-broker-pods[]

--
oc::
+
--
[#eventing-trigger-broker-oc-see-broker-pods]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",linenums]
----
oc label namespace {tutorial-namespace} get pods
----
copyToClipboard::eventing-trigger-broker-oc-see-broker-pods[]
--
====

Running  the above command should return the following result:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
NAME                                      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
default-broker-filter-5bb94d8ddf-r9j4v    2/2       Running   1          2m43s
default-broker-ingress-59b9b4985c-8n6d4   2/2       Running   1          2m43s

[#eventing-gen-service]
=== Generate Service

Run the following command to create the Knative service that will be used as the subscriber for the events that are going to be published later:

[#eventing-run-gen-service]

yq w -i service.yaml spec.runLatest.configuration.revisionTemplate.spec.container.image pass:[$DESTINATION_IMAGE_NAME]

----

<1> Set from `pass:[${DESTINATION_IMAGE_NAME}]` environment variable --  the fully qualified container image that will be pushed to the registry as part of the build --

Refer to xref:ROOT:{build-repo}/build.adoc#build-set-env[Build Environment Variables]

[NOTE,subs="macros+"]
====
If you have skipped the xref:ROOT:{build-repo}/build.adoc[Build] or xref:ROOT:05-build/build-templates.adoc[Build Templates] and dont have the container image of `event-greeter`; then you can update the Knative serving service to use the pre-built event-greeter image available at `quay.io/rhdevelopers/knative-tutorial-greeter:0.0.1`
====

[#eventing-deploy-service]
=== Deploy Service

Run the following commands to create the service:

----

<1> The type of event source. `ContainerSource` type is basically a container sending events.
<2> The image to run with this `ContainerSource`. Source of the image is available link:https://github.com/knative/eventing-sources/blob/v0.5.0/cmd/heartbeats/main.go[here].
<3> Arguments for the `ContainerSource` image. `label` in this particular case is what the image will be sending as event data and `period` is how often it will send events.
<4> Sink here is the `default` broker created earlier. So, the `default` broker will receive the events sent by this event source.

Run the following commands to create the event source resources:

:doc-sec: eventing-trigger-broker-create-event-source
:url: {github-repo}/{eventing-repo}/knative/event-source-broker.yaml
:url-alt-text: event-source-broker.yaml

----

<1> The event type to filter on. The event type `dev.knative.eventing.samples.heartbeat` is the one used by the `ContainerSource` image we deployed earlier. 
<2> Definition of the subscriber for the events that are matched by the filter of the trigger.
<3> In this case, the subscriber is a service.
<4> Subscriber service name. This trigger will make sure the events filtered will be sent to this service.

Run the following commands to create the event source resources:

:doc-sec: eventing-trigger-broker-create-trigger
