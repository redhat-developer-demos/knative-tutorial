== Prerequisite CLI tools

The following CLI tools are required for running the exercises in this tutorial. Please have them installed and configured before you get started with any of the tutorial chapters.

You don't have to have both `Minikube` and `Minishift`. Also, if you have an existing OpenShift cluster you can also use it.

[#remote-docker-repository]
== Remote Repository
For some parts of the tutorial, you will be pushing and pulling container images to and from a remote image repository. You will need an account with publish rights. As of this writing, knative works best with https://hub.docker.com[Docker Hub].

[#download-tutorial-sources]
== Download Tutorial Sources
Before we start setting up the environment, let's clone the tutorial sources and set the `TUTORIAL_HOME` environment variable to point to the root directory of the tutorial:

[#cloneRepo]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
git clone https://github.com/redhat-developer-demos/knative-tutorial 
----
copyToClipboard::cloneRepo[]

The `work` folder in `$TUTORIAL_HOME` can be used to download the demo application resources and refer to them during the exercises. The `work` folder has a README with instructions on the source code repo and git commands to clone the sources.

This tutorial was developed and tested with:

- Knative `{knative-version}`
- Minikube `{minikube-version}`
- OpenShift `{openshift-version}`
- Minishift `{minishift-version}`

[#setup-work-folder]
== Work folder

The work folder i.e `$TUTORIAL_HOME/work` can be used as a work directory during the build. The README in the work folder has the GitHub repository links of the applications `greeter` and `event-greeter` that will be used in various exercises.
