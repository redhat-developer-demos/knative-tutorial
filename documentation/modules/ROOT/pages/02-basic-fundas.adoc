== Deploy Service

Navigate to the tutorial chapter's `knative` folder:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
cd $TUTORIAL_HOME/01-basics/knative
----

The following snippet shows how a Knative service YAML will look like:


.link:{github-repo}/{basics-repo}/knative/service.yaml[service.yaml]
[source,yaml,linenums]
----
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: greeter
spec:
  runLatest: #<1>
    configuration:
      revisionTemplate:
        spec:
          container:
            image: dev.local/rhdevelopers/greeter:0.0.1 #<2>
----

<1> Makes Knative to always run the latest revision of the deployment
<2> It is very important that the image is a fully qualified name docker image name with tag. For more details on this xref:ROOT:faq.adoc#faq-q2[Question 2 of FAQ]

The service could be deployed using the command:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kubectl apply -n knativetutorial -f link:{github-repo}/{basics-repo}/knative/service.yaml[service.yaml]
----

.(OR)

[source,bash,linenums,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc apply -n knativetutorial -f link:{github-repo}/{basics-repo}/knative/service.yaml[service.yaml]
----


After successful deployment of the service we should see a kubernetes deployment called `greeter-00001-deployment` available.

[#basics-invoke-service]
== Invoke Service

:k8s-env: minikube
:k8s-cli: kubectl
include::ROOT:partial$invoke-service.adoc[tag=*]

.(OR)

:k8s-env: minishift
:k8s-cli: oc
include::ROOT:partial$invoke-service.adoc[tag=*]

The last curl command should return a response like **Hi greeter => greeter-00001-deployment-5d696cc6c8-m65s5: 1**

NOTE: Sometimes the response might not be returned immediately especially when the pod is coming up from dormant state, at those times try giving request again

[#basics-see-what-you-have-deployed]
== See what you have deployed

The service-based deployment strategy that we did now will create many Knative resources, the following commands will help you to query and find what has been deployed.

[#basics-show-knative-services]
=== service 
include::partial$knative-objects.adoc[tag=knative-services]

[#basics-show-knative-configs]
=== configuration
include::partial$knative-objects.adoc[tag=knative-configs]

[#basics-show-knative-routes]
=== routes
include::partial$knative-objects.adoc[tag=knative-routes]

When the service was invoked with `curl -H "Host:greeter.knativetutorial.example.com" $IP_ADDRESS`,you noticed that we added a **Host** header to the request with value `greeter.knativetutorial.example.com`,this FQDN is automatically assigned to your Knative service by the Knative Routes,it uses the format like `**<service-name>.<namespace>.<domain-suffix>**`.

[NOTE]
====
* The domain suffix in this case __example.com__ is configurable via the config map **config-domain** of **knative-serving** namespace.
====

[#basics-show-knative-revisions]
=== revisions
include::partial$knative-objects.adoc[tag=knative-revisions]

[TIP]
====
* add `-oyaml` to the commands above to see more details

[#deploying-new-revision]
== Deploy new Revision Service

As Knative follows https://12factor.net[12-Factor] application principles, any new https://12factor.net/config[configuration] change will trigger new revision of the deployment. 
 
To deploy a new revision of the greeter service, we will add an environment variable to the existing service as shown below:

[#basics-service-rev2]
=== Service revision 2

.link:{github-repo}/{basics-repo}/knative/service-env.yaml[service-env.yaml]
[source,yaml,linenums]
----
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: greeter
spec:
  runLatest:
    configuration:
      revisionTemplate:
        spec:
          container:
            image: dev.local/rhdevelopers/greeter:0.0.1
            env:
             - name: MESSAGE_PREFIX #<1>
               value: Namaste
----

<1> Adding an environment variable that will be used as the message prefix

Let us deploy the new revision using the command:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kubectl apply -n knativetutorial -f link:{github-repo}/{basics-repo}/knative/service-env.yaml[service-env.yaml]
----

.(OR)

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc apply -n knativetutorial -f link:{github-repo}/{basics-repo}/knative/service-env.yaml[service-env.yaml]
----

After successful deployment of the service we should see a kubernetes deployment called `greeter-00002-deployment` available in the OpenShift dashboard:

image::greeter-00002.png[Greeter Service rev2]

Now running the <<basics-show-knative-revisions,command>> will show two revisions namely `greeter-00001` and `greeter-0002`.

<<basics-invoke-service,Invoking Service>> will now show an output like **Namaste greeter => greeter-00002-deployment-8d9984dc8-rgzx6: 2**, where __Namaste__ is the value that we configured via environment variable in the Knative service resource file.

[#basics-pinning-revision]
== Pinning service to a revision

As you noticed that the Knative services always routes the traffic to the **latest** revision of the service deployment, thats because of the **runLatest** attribute in <<basics-service-rev2,service resource file>>.

Let us now make the greeter service use earlier revision `greeter-00001`. 

[TIP]
====
You can use the get <<basics-show-knative-revisions, show knative revisions>> command to find the available revisions for the greeter service.
====

=== Service pinned to revision 1

.link:{github-repo}/{basics-repo}/knative/service-pinned-rev1.yaml[service-pinned-rev1.yaml]
[source,yaml,linenums]
----
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: greeter
spec:
  release: #<1>
    revisions: ["greeter-00001"]
  configuration:
    revisionTemplate:
      spec:
        container:
          image: dev.local/rhdevelopers/greeter:0.0.1
----

<1> The **release** attribute in service resource file will make Knative use the revision specified in the **revisions** attribute.

Let redeploy the greeter service to be pinned to revision __greeter-00001__:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kubectl apply -n knativetutorial -f link:{github-repo}/{basics-repo}/knative/service-pinned-rev1.yaml[service-pinned-rev1.yaml]
----

.(OR)

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc apply -n knativetutorial -f link:{github-repo}/{basics-repo}/knative/service-pinned-rev1.yaml[service-pinned-rev1.yaml]
----

<<basics-invoke-service,Invoking Service>> will now show an output like **Hi greeter => greeter-00001-deployment-5d696cc6c8-m65s5: 3**.

[#basics-cleanup]
== Cleanup

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kubectl -n knativetutorial delete services.serving.knative.dev greeter
----

.(OR)

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc -n knativetutorial delete services.serving.knative.dev greeter
----
