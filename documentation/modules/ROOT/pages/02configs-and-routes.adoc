= Configurations and Routes
include::_attributes.adoc[]

At the end of this chapter you will be able to understand and know how to :

* Deploy Knative configurations and routes separately.
* Distribute traffic between revisions of a service.

[#crtd-deploy-configuration]
== Deploy Configuration

In the previous chapter we saw how we can deploy services using a holistic service resource file, in this chapter we will see how to deploy the service using configurations and route files.

Navigate to the tutorial chapter's `knative` folder:

[source,bash]
----
cd $TUTORIAL_HOME/02-configs-and-routes
----

=== Deploy Configuration revision 1

The following snippet shows how a Knative configuration resource YAML looks like:

[source,yaml,linenums]
----
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Configuration
metadata:
  name: greeter
spec:
  revisionTemplate:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: greeter
    spec:
      container:
        image: dev.local/rhdevelopers/greeter:0.0.1 #<1>
----

[.text-center]
**configuration-rev1.yaml**

<1> It is very important that the image is a fully qualified docker image name, including a  tag. For more details on this <<faq-q2,Question 2 of FAQ>>.

The service is then deployed using:

[source,bash,linenums]
----
oc apply -n knativetutorial -f config/configuration-rev1.yaml
----

[.text-center]
**(OR)**

[source,bash,linenums]
----
kubectl apply -n knativetutorial -f config/configuration-rev1.yaml
----

After the deployment was successful, we should see a kubernetes deployment called `greeter-00001-deployment`.

image::greeter-00001.png[Greeter Service]

[#crtd-invoke-service]
== Invoke Service

include::partial$invoke-service.adoc[tag=*]

The command will return `HTTP 404` as there are no routes deployed yet. Let us now deploy a route.

[#crtd-deploy-route]
== Deploy Route
Let us now deploy a route that will route all the traffic to the configuration we just deployed.

[source,yaml,linenums]
----
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: greeter
spec:
  traffic:
    - configurationName: greeter
      percent: 100
----

[.text-center]
**route_default.yaml**

[source,bash,linenums]
----
oc apply -n knativetutorial -f route/route_default.yaml
----

[.text-center]
**(OR)**

[source,bash,linenums]
----
kubectl apply -n knativetutorial -f route/route_default.yaml
----

<<invoke-service,Invoking Service>> now should return a response like **Hi greeter => greeter-00001-deployment-5d696cc6c8-m65s5: 1**

NOTE: Sometimes the response might not be returned immediately especially when the pod is coming up from a dormant state. You might need to be a little patient.

[#crtd-see-what-you-have-deployed]
== See what you have deployed

As we did not deploy a service this time

[#crtd-show-knative-services]
=== service 
include::partial$knative-objects.adoc[tag=knative-services]

will throw an error as there are no knative services deployed as part of the configuration + routes based deployment strategy. 

[#crtd-show-knative-configs]
=== configuration
include::partial$knative-objects.adoc[tag=knative-configs]

[#crtd-show-knative-routes]
=== routes
include::partial$knative-objects.adoc[tag=knative-routes]

When the service is invoked with `curl -H "Host: greeter.knativetutorial.example.com" $IP_ADDRESS`, you noticed that we added a **Host** header to the `curl` command with the value `greeter.knativetutorial.example.com`. This FQDN is automatically assigned to your Knative service by the Knative route we created. It follows a format `<route-name>.<namespace>.<domain-suffix>`.

[NOTE]
====
* The `domain-suffix` (in this case __example.com__) is configurable via the config map **config-domain** in the **knative-serving** namespace.
====

[#crtd-show-knative-revisions]
=== revisions
include::partial$knative-objects.adoc[tag=knative-revisions]

[TIP]
====
* add `-oyaml` to the commands above to see more details

[#crtd-deploying-new-revision]
== Deploy a new revision

Knative follows a revision model for its configurations. Each time you change something in the `revisionTemplate` Knative will effectively generate a new revision and thus a new deployment. In this example we add a new environment variable to demonstrate that mechanism. 

=== Deploy configuration revision 2 
[source,yaml,linenums]
----
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Configuration
metadata:
  name: greeter
spec:
  revisionTemplate:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: greeter
    spec:
      container:
        image: dev.local/rhdevelopers/greeter:0.0.1
        env: #<1>
          - name: MESSAGE_PREFIX
            value: Hello
----

[.text-center]
**configuration-rev2.yaml**

<1> Adding an environment variable that will be used a message prefix.

Let us deploy the new revision using the command:

[source,bash,linenums]
----
oc apply -n knativetutorial -f config/configuration-rev2.yaml
----

[.text-center]
**(OR)**

[source,bash,linenums]
----
kubectl apply -n knativetutorial -f config/configuration-rev2.yaml
----

After the deployment was successful we should see a kubernetes deployment called `greeter-00002-deployment` in the OpenShift dashboard:

image::greeter-00002.png[Greeter Service rev2]

Now running the <<show-knative-revisions,command>> will show two revisions: `greeter-00001` and `greeter-0002`.

<<invoke-service,Invoking Service>> will now show an output like **Hello greeter => greeter-00002-deployment-8d9984dc8-rgzx6: 2**, where __Hello__ is the value that we configured via environment variable in the Knative service resource file.

[#crtd-distributing-traffic]
== Distributing traffic

When deploying services with service object based approach, the service resource will take care of traffic distribution either 100% to latest or pinned revision. In this section we will explore how we can deploy routes to distribute traffic between deployed revisions.

[NOTE]
====
For the sake of clarity we will call greeter-00001 as **revision 1** and greeter-00002 as **revision 2**
====

Before we start to apply routes, let us open a new terminal and run the following command `$TUTORIAL_HOME/02-configs-and-routes/bin/call.sh`, this command will keep sending requests to greeter route every two seconds which allows us to monitor the changes to the responses as we keep applying the route that will distribute the traffic between the available two revisions.

[#crtd-all-rev1]
=== Send all traffic to revision 1
[source,bash,linenums]
----
oc apply -n knativetutorial -f route/route_all_rev1.yaml
----

[.text-center]
**(OR)**

[source,bash,linenums]
----
kubectl apply -n knativetutorial -f route/route_all_rev1.yaml
----

You will notice the output on your monitoring terminal to be something like **Hi greeter => greeter-00001-deployment-5d696cc6c8-m65s5: 34**.

[#crtd-all-rev2]
=== Send all traffic to revision 2
[source,bash,linenums]
----
oc apply -n knativetutorial -f route/route_all_rev2.yaml
----

[.text-center]
**(OR)**

[source,bash,linenums]
----
kubectl apply -n knativetutorial -f route/route_all_rev2.yaml
----

You will notice the output on your monitoring terminal to be something like **Hello greeter => greeter-00002-deployment-8d9984dc8-rgzx6: 13**.

[#crtd-all-rev1-rev2-50]
=== 50-50 split between revision 1 and revision 2
[source,bash,linenums]
----
oc apply -n knativetutorial -f route/route_rev1-50_rev2-50.yaml
----

[.text-center]
**(OR)**

[source,bash,linenums]
----
kubectl apply -n knativetutorial -f route/route_rev1-50_rev2-50.yaml
----

You will notice the output will be mix of responses like **Hi greeter => greeter-00001-deployment-5d696cc6c8-m65s5: 11** and **Hello greeter => greeter-00002-deployment-8d9984dc8-rgzx6: 10** approximately distributed 50% between the two.

[#crtd-all-rev1-rev2-75-25]
=== 75-25 split between revision 1 and revision 2
[source,bash,linenums]
----
oc apply -n knativetutorial -f route/route_rev1-75_rev2-25.yaml
----

[.text-center]
**(OR)**

[source,bash,linenums]
----
kubectl apply -n knativetutorial -f route/route_rev1-75_rev2-25.yaml
----

You will notice the output will be mix of responses like **Hi greeter => greeter-00001-deployment-5d696cc6c8-m65s5: 6** and **Hello greeter => greeter-00002-deployment-8d9984dc8-rgzx6: 7**, with more requests responded by revision  1 approximately distributed 75% to 25 % between revision 1 and revision 2.

[#crtd-all-rev1-rev2-10-90]
=== 10-90 split between revision 1 and revision 2
[source,bash,linenums]
----
oc apply -n knativetutorial -f route/route_rev1-10_rev2-90.yaml
----

[.text-center]
**(OR)**

[source,bash,linenums]
----
kubectl apply -n knativetutorial -f route/route_rev1-10_rev2-90.yaml
----

You will notice the will be mix of responses like **Hi greeter => greeter-00001-deployment-5d696cc6c8-m65s5: 4** and **Hello greeter => greeter-00002-deployment-8d9984dc8-rgzx6: 5**, with more requests responded by revision 2 approximately 10% to 90% between revision 1 and revision 2.

[NOTE]
====
In the response texts e.g **Hi greeter => greeter-00001-deployment-5d696cc6c8-m65s5: 4** the numbers at the end of the responses shows a count of how may requests have been handled by the service. In this example it is __4__. Also note that the output count number may vary according to number of requests that you might have issued.
