Use the Knative Eventing `Broker` and `Trigger` Custom Resources to allow for link:https://cloudevents.io/[CloudEvent] attribute filtering.

[#broker]
== Broker

.link:{github-repo}/{eventing-repo}/default-broker.yaml[default-broker]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
---
apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
kind: broker
metadata:

Verify the created resources:

include::eventing:partial$knative-objects.adoc[tags=knative-eventing-broker]

[#eventing-service]
== Service 

Now, that you have the broker configured, you need to create the sinks `eventingaloha` and `eventingbonjour`, which will receive the filtered events.

.link:{github-repo}/{eventing-repo}/eventing-aloha-sink.yaml[eventing-aloha-sink.yaml]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
include::eventing:example$eventing/eventing-aloha-sink.yaml[]
----

.link:{github-repo}/{eventing-repo}/eventing-bonjour-sink.yaml[eventing-bonjour-sink.yaml]
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
include::eventing:example$eventing/eventing-bonjour-sink.yaml[]
----

[NOTE]
====
The image being used by both of these services is identical.  However, the difference in name `aloha` vs `bonjour` will make obvious which one is receiving a particular event.
====

[#eventing-deploy-service]
=== Deploy Service

Run the following commands to deploy the `eventingaloha` and `eventingbonjour` services:

:service-file: eventing-aloha-sink.yaml
:sink-service-name: eventingaloha
:revision-name: eventingaloha-v1
==== Deploy Aloha
include::eventing:partial$deploy-knative-resources.adoc[tags=tab-1;eventing-hello-sink;tab-2]

:service-file: eventing-bonjour-sink.yaml
:sink-service-name: eventingbonjour
:revision-name: eventingbonjour-v1
==== Deploy Bonjour
include::eventing:partial$deploy-knative-resources.adoc[tags=tab-1;eventing-hello-sink;tab-2]

Wait approximately 60 seconds for `eventingaloha` and `eventingbonjour` to terminate, scale-down to zero before proceeding.

[#eventing-trigger]
== Trigger

Now create the the trigger for `eventingaloha` that will associate the filtered events to a service:

.link:{github-repo}/{eventing-repo}/trigger-helloaloha.yaml[trigger-helloaloha.yaml]
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
kind: Trigger
metadata:
  name: helloaloha
spec:
  broker: default
  filter:
    attributes:
      type: aloha # <1>
  subscriber:
    ref:
     apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
     kind: Service
     name: eventingaloha
----

<1> The `type` is the CloudEvent type that is mapped to the `ce-type` HTTP header.  A Trigger can filter by link:https://cloudevents.io/[CloudEvent] attributes such as type, source or extension.

Now create the the trigger for `eventingaloha` that will associate the filtered events to a service:

:service-file: trigger-helloaloha.yaml
:trigger-name: helloaloha
:trigger-sub-name: eventingaloha
:trigger-event: aloha
=== Create Aloha Trigger
include::eventing:partial$deploy-knative-resources.adoc[tags=tab-1;eventing-trigger-sub;tab-2]

:service-file: trigger-hellobonjour.yaml
:trigger-name: hellobonjour
:trigger-sub-name: eventingbonjour
:trigger-event: bonjour
=== Create Bonjour Trigger
Now create the the trigger for `eventingbonjour` that will associate the filtered events to a service:

.link:{github-repo}/{eventing-repo}/trigger-hellobonjour.yaml[trigger-hellobonjour.yaml]
[source,yaml,linenums,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
include::eventing:example$eventing/trigger-hellobonjour.yaml[]
----

Run the following commands to create the trigger:

include::eventing:partial$deploy-knative-resources.adoc[tags=tab-1;eventing-trigger-sub;tab-2]

Verify that your triggers are ready:

include::eventing:partial$knative-objects.adoc[tag=knative-triggers]

[#eventing-trigger-verification]
== Verification

Pull out the broker URI:

[#eventing-triggers-verify-sub3]
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kubectl get broker default -o jsonpath='{.status.address.url}'
----

The command should show the output as: 
[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
http://broker-ingress.knative-eventing.svc.cluster.local/{tutorial-namespace}/default
----

You should notice that the broker URI is a Kubernetes services with the suffix of `{tutorial-namespace}.svc.cluster.local`.  This means they can be interacted with from another pod within the Kubernetes cluster.

Now that you have setup the Broker and Triggers you need to send in some test messages to see the behavior.

First start streaming the logs for the event consumers:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
stern eventing -c user-container
----

Then create a pod for using the `curl` command:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    run: curler
  name: curler
spec:
  containers:
  - name: curler
    image: fedora:29 # <1>
    tty: true
----

<1> You can use any image that includes a curl command.

Wait for the `curler` pod to be running and then exec into the `curler` pod:

[#trigger-verify-curler]
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
-----
kubectl -n {tutorial-namespace} apply -f curler.yaml
-----

Exec into the `curler` pod:

[trigger-verify-exec-curler]
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kubectl -n {tutorial-namespace} exec -it curler -- /bin/bash
----

Using the `curler` pod's shell, curl the broker URI for eventingaloha:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
curl -v "http://broker-ingress.{tutorial-namespace}.svc.cluster.local" \
-X POST \
-H "Ce-Id: say-hello" \
-H "Ce-Specversion: 1.0" \
-H "Ce-Type: greeting" \
-H "Ce-Source: mycurl" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"key":"from a curl"}'
----

You will then see `eventingaloha` will scale-up to respond to that event:

[#trigger-watch-aloha-scale]
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
-----
watch kubectl get pods
-----

The command above should show the following output:

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
-----
NAME                                        READY STATUS  AGE
curler                                      1/1   Running 59s
eventingaloha-1-deployment-6cdc888d9d-9xnnn 2/2   Running 30s
-----

Next, curl the broker URI for `eventingbonjour`:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
curl -v "http://broker-ingress.{tutorial-namespace}.svc.cluster.local" \
-X POST \
-H "Ce-Id: say-hello" \
-H "Ce-Specversion: 1.0" \
-H "Ce-Type: greeting" \
-H "Ce-Source: mycurl" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"key":"from a curl"}'
----

And you will see the `eventingbonjour` pod scale up:

[#trigger-watch-eventingbonjour-scale]
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
-----
watch kubectl get pods
-----

The command above should show the following output:

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
-----
NAME                                         READY STATUS  AGE
curler                                       1/1   Running 82s
eventingaloha-1-deployment-6cdc888d9d-9xnnn  2/2   Running 53s
eventingbonjour-1-deployment-fc7858b5b-s9prj 2/2   Running 5s
-----

It was verified how each payload configured with either `type: aloha` or `type: bonjour` sent to the broker, then each trigger was able to filter each incoming message and send to the designated service set in the trigger.

You can experiment by using different type filters in the Subscription to see how the different subscribed services respond. `Filters` may use an link:https://cloudevents.io/[CloudEvent] attribute for its criteria.
