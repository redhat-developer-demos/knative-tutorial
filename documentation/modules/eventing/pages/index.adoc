= Knative Eventing

.CloudEvents
****
https://cloudevents.io/[CloudEvents] is a specification for describing event data in a common way. An event might be produced by any number of sources (e.g. Kafka, S3, GCP PubSub, MQTT) and as a software developer, you want a common abstraction for all event inputs.

== Usage Patterns

There are three primary usage patterns with Knative Eventing:

Source to Sink::
  Source to Service provides the simplest getting started experience with Knative Eventing. It provides single _Sink_ -- that is, event receiving service --, with no queuing, backpressure, and filtering. The Source to Service does not support replies, which means the response from the _Sink_ service is ignored. As shown in the Figure 1, the responsibility of the Event Source it just to deliver the message without waiting for the response from the Sink, hence I think it will be apt to compare Source to Sink to _fire and forget_ messaging pattern.

Channel and Subscription::
  With the _Channel_ and _Subscription_, the Knative Eventing system defines a _Channel_, which can connect to various backends such as In-Memory, Kafka and GCP PubSub for sourcing the events. Each Channel can have one or more subscribers in the form of _Sink_ services as shown in Figure 2, which can receive the event messages and process them as needed. Each message from the Channel is formatted as _CloudEvent_ and sent further up in the chain to other Subscribers for further processing. The Channels and Subscription usage pattern does not have the ability to filter messages.

Broker and Trigger::
  The _Broker_ and _Trigger_ are similar to Channel and Subscription, except that they support filtering of events. Event filtering is a method that allows the subscribers to show an interest on certain set of messages that flows into the Broker. For each Broker, Knative Eventing will implicitly create a Knative Eventing Channel. As shown in Figure 3, the Trigger gets itself subscribed to the Broker and applies the filter on the messages on its subscribed broker. The filters are applied on the on the Cloud Event attributes of the messages, before delivering it to the interested Sink Services(subscribers).
